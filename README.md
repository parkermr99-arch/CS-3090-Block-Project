# CS-3090-Block-Project: Simple Encryption Tool
This is a simple encryption tool used for demonstrating an ethical hacking/security concept for CS 3090: Ethics in Computing.
Please keep in mind that this tool is intentionally simple, and only works for a specific set of characters. This tool is
meant for educational purposes!

# Program
This program takes a user input message and encrypts it using some simple hex number mappings and simple math operations.
Then it will output a string of numbers that represents the encrypted message. The program allows messages containing
lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, spaces, and the following special characters: ! @ # $ % ^ & * but anything
else is not accepted (to keep it simple). However, it would not be very difficult to expand upon this to allow more types
of characters.

# Usage
This program can simply be used and run by running the main method. It does not require any other dependencies other than
running it in a python IDE. The function that actually does the encryption could also be adapted to work in other functions
other than main if necessary.

# Warnings and Limitations
This tool is intentionally simple and should not be used for storing sensitive information, as it is for educational use!

# Ethical Considerations
This tool can be used responsibly for demonstrating a simple form of encryption, however, it can also be expanded upon and
made much stronger for implementing other programs and tools. This tool could potentially be modified and used to store data 
elsewhere, and may not be fully secure, so please take caution! Again, this tool is meant for educational purposes and has
its limitations. Even if it is expanded upon, there is no guarantee that it will be fully secure.
